# 4-color-theorem
Basic implementation of the 4th color Theorem using Python programming language

# TWO versions of the algorithm 4 color theorem 

# first version: basic implementation of the algorithm 

The Four Color Theorem is a famous result in graph theory and mathematics. It states that any map, represented as a collection of regions, can be colored using at most four different colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions have the same color.

an easy implementation of that is available in the file "theoren_4_color.py" with an example of execution.

# second version: using Opencv Library to apply this algorithm on a non-colored map 

FIRST STEP : 
try to split the map into regions 

SECOND STEP :
try to extract the neighbours of every regions 

THIRD STEP :
Color the regions using the 4-color-THEOREM 


# NB: some installation u need to do if u using opencv 

pip install opencv-python

pip install opencv-contrib-python

pip install opencv-python-headless

pip install numpy
